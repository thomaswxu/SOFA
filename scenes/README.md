These scenes focus on analyzing contact forces of a bending pneunet/FEA on an object of varying stiffness levels.

The .pyscn (Python) and .scn (XML) implementations are largely equivalent, with some additional options in the Python implementation.
The .pyscn is likely slightly more up to date than the .scn version.

Note that the default SOFA scene type is .scn
